# FEM solution to the dynamic graphene Euler-Bernoulli beam equation in 1d

Author: Mansur Shakipov

The fully nonlinear variation of the dynamic Euler-Bernoulli beam equation corresponding to the graphene material is solved using Hermite cubic elements with a special nonlinear approximation. The time discretization scheme is taken from [1]. The Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes and weights generator routine is taken from [2].
